1. **Chassis and Wheels:**
   - The chassis is the main frame of your AGV, providing the structure for attaching other components.
   - Wheels and motors are essential for the movement of the AGV.
   - Depending on your design and requirements, you can choose different types of chassis and wheels, such as plastic or metal frames and different wheel sizes.

2. **Motor Driver (L298N):**
   - The L298N motor driver module is commonly used to control the speed and direction of DC motors.
   - It typically supports two DC motors and can handle currents up to a few amperes per motor.
   - It's easy to use with a Raspberry Pi or other microcontrollers.

3. **Raspberry Pi:**
   - A Raspberry Pi is a versatile single-board computer that can run various operating systems, including Linux.
   - It has GPIO pins that you can use to interface with sensors, motor drivers, and other hardware.
   - Raspberry Pi models like the 3B+ or 4 are recommended for robotics projects due to their processing power and connectivity options.

4. **LiPo Battery:**
   - A 3S LiPo battery provides power to your AGV.
   - The 3S refers to the number of cells in the battery (3), providing a nominal voltage of 11.1V.
   - The capacity, in this case, is 5500mAh, indicating the amount of energy the battery can store.
   - The "45C" rating suggests the maximum discharge rate, which can affect how much current the battery can provide.

5. **Voltage Regulator:**
   - A voltage regulator module steps down the voltage from the LiPo battery to a stable 5V supply for the Raspberry Pi.
   - Ensure it can handle the power requirements of the Raspberry Pi and any additional components connected to it.

6. **Switches and Connectors:**
   - Power switches allow you to turn the AGV on and off.
   - Connectors are essential for wiring the components together. Make sure they are compatible with your components.

7. **Sensors (optional):**
   - Ultrasonic sensors can be used for obstacle detection and avoidance.
   - A camera module (such as the Raspberry Pi Camera) can be used for vision-based tasks and remote monitoring.

8. **Miscellaneous Components:**
   - Jumper wires, a breadboard, and mounting hardware are typically used for connecting and securing components on the AGV.

9. **MQTT Dashboard App Development (if outsourced):**
   - If you're not developing the app yourself, you may need to hire a developer or a development team to create the MQTT dashboard app.
   - Costs can vary depending on the complexity of the app and the hourly rates of developers.

10. **Tools and Equipment:**
    - Soldering iron, screwdrivers, multimeter, and other tools are needed for assembly, wiring, and troubleshooting.

When selecting these components, consider factors such as compatibility, power requirements, and the specific needs of your AGV project. Additionally, ensure that the components are sourced from reputable suppliers to guarantee quality and reliability.
